## Introduction

Rabbithole-rs is a nearly well-typed, user-friendly [JSON:API](https://jsonapi.org/) type system,
with an easy-to-use Macro System to help you modelling the your data.

Inspired a lot by [jsonapi-rust](https://github.com/michiel/jsonapi-rust), in fact, all of the sample data in `tests` are just from this crate. Nice job, michiel!


### So what is [JSON:API](https://jsonapi.org/)?

> If youâ€™ve ever argued with your team about the way your JSON responses should be formatted, JSON:API can be your anti-bikeshedding tool.
> 
> By following shared conventions, you can increase productivity, take advantage of generalized tooling, and focus on what matters: your application.

When you are designing a RESTful API, the most troubling problem is **how to design the Data Structure**, especially how to **design the Error System**. So JSON:API
design a Specification for the people like you to specify some rules to help you handling the design problem and free your days!

Maybe the specification is L\~~O\~~N\~~G\~~ and boring, like reading a textbook, but believe me, you will learn a lot from it, just like a textbook. :)

### So why yet another JSON:API crate?

#### RSQL support needed

One of the main reason of this crate is that I need to support RSQL/FIQL, for I think it is a well-defined query system for complex querying. The JSON:API does not
given a official Query/Filter solution, but I think RSQL/FIQL is good enough to handle my project.

For more infomation about RSQL/FIQL, see:

- [rsql-rs](https://github.com/UkonnRa/rsql-rs), my project, please have a look and give me a Star, THX!
- [rsql-parser](https://github.com/jirutka/rsql-parser) (Maybe the best RSQL parser implementation)
- [FIQL Specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-nottingham-atompub-fiql-00)

#### Well Typed System

As a Scala player, I believe a well designed type system can just avoid a lot of problem.
And I want to know if Rust's ADT System can handle the problem with this kind of complexity.
In fact, it can handle it well.

#### An user-friendly Macro and Modelling

As a Java developer, I prefer the annotation system a lot. Thankfully, Rust uses [proc_macro](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/procedural-macros.html) system
to give the users "most-exactly-the-same" experience.

For example, instead of:

```rust
#[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Serialize, Deserialize)]
struct Dog {
    id: String,
    name: String,
    age: i32,
    main_flea: Flea,
    fleas: Vec<Flea>,
}
jsonapi_model!(Dog; "dog"; has one main_flea; has many fleas);
```

I can model my data structure like this:

```rust
#[derive(rbh_derive::EntityDecorator, Serialize, Deserialize, Clone)]
#[entity(type = "dogs")]
pub struct Dog<'a> {
    #[entity(id)]
    pub id: String,
    pub name: String,
    #[entity(to_many)]
    pub fleas: Vec<Flea>,
    #[entity(to_many)]
    pub friends: Vec<Dog<'a>>,
    #[entity(to_one)]
    #[serde(bound(deserialize = "Box<Human<'a>>: Deserialize<'de>"))]
    pub master: Box<Human<'a>>,
    #[entity(to_one)]
    pub best_one: Option<Box<Dog<'a>>>,
}
```
For me, the second one is more beautiful.

## Features

- [x] Basic JSON:API model system
- [x] Basic Macro System
- [x] Basic tests

- [ ] Query/Filter API
- [ ] [Stricter type checking and error hints](#type-checking-and-error-hints-in-macro-system)
- [ ] [A high performance JSON:API Server](#a-high-performance-server)

## Future Works

### Type checking and error hints in Marco System

There are lots of type restrictions in rabbithole-rs. for example:

- `[#to_one]` decorator can only be use on a **field** with the type of being:
  - a `rabbithole::entity::Entity`
  - or a *wrapper* class of `rabbithole::entity::Entity`, where `wrapper` class is one of:
    - `Option<T>`
    - `Box<T>`
    - `&T`
    - A wrapper class inside another, like `Option<Box<T>>`

- `#[to_many]` decorator can only use on a **field** with (all of):
  - an iterator,
  - the inner type of the iterator should meet the above restriction
  - no nested List (discussing)

Now because of lacking the Reflection in Rust, the macro now can not check type errors at all, so some solutions may needed.

### A high performance Server

Because the API interface of JSON:API is complex, I think it's a redundant and boring work to write all the API interface following the specification yourself,
so I will do the boring things for you!
